/**
 * Allows Plugins to be attached to objects implementing this interface; the Pluggable is responsible for instantiating
 * and managing the lifecycle of all attached Plugins.
 *
 * When loadPlugins is invoked, for each registered Plugin:
 *
 * 1. If the registered Plugin is a PluginDependentPlugin gather the dependencies and complete this process for each one
 * before continuing.
 * 2. Instantiate the Plugin using the Application's Injector. Please see more about this in the documentation about
 * Injector dependency below.
 * 3. If the registered Plugin is an InjectorAwarePlugin the Injector should be provided so that the object graph for
 * the Plugin can be wired properly.
 * 4. If the registered Plugin is an EventAwarePlugin the Emitter should be provided so that any listeners can be
 * registered.
 * 5. If the registered Plugin has any custom Plugin handlers each one should be invoked in the order it was registered.
 * Each handler can be asynchronous and is resolved before the next handler is invoked.
 * 6. If the registered Plugin is a BootablePlugin it should have its boot() method invoked.
 *
 * When removePlugin invoked:
 *
 * 1. If the loaded Plugin is an EventAwarePlugin the emitter should be provided to allow removing of any listeners.
 * 2. If the loaded Plugin has any remove handler associated to it invoke it. A remove handler MAY NOT be asynchronous.
 *
 * Injector Dependency Management
 * =====================================================================================================================
 * The nature of a Pluggable, both in its need to instantiate Plugins using the Injector and to provide the Injector for
 * InjectorAwarePlugin types, requires that an Injector be passed in as a constructor dependency. This can cause issues
 * with your Injector having greater potential of being turned into a service locator which violates one of the core
 * tenets of Labrador.
 *
 * To combat against this we highly recommend that some object is created that encapsulates the need for the Injector
 * dependency and exposes to your Application code only the Pluggable interface. Your Application can then delegate all
 * of the required Pluggable methods to this implementation and is not required to be aware of the Injector directly.
 *
 * It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use the existing Cspray\Labrador\Plugin\PluginManager implementation for this
 * purpose. It is highly tested and known to operate in a manner expected of this interface.
